    It seems that your browser is not supporting some required functionalities or we know about troubles with your browser.
    That's the reason why you are using the auto tagger in a legacy mode. Basically that's not a problem but it means your are sending the a
    downsampled version of your image (256 x 256px) to our backend instead of a small feature vector. As an example, the feature vector of the
    non-legacy mode has a size of 360 Byte while the image in the legacy mode has ~250 kByte.
